## Exams

**Three** possible **options**: _theoretical_, _practical_, and _quiz_.

### Theoretical

_Make_ **short survey** with **at least 3 papers** from the [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org) **e-Print archive**.

### Practical

_Solve_ **at least 2** of the _following exercises_:

1. Research and compare the different security protocols used in cloud computing, such as SSL/TLS, SSH, and IPSec. Write a report outlining their strengths and weaknesses and make recommendations for which one to use in different scenarios.
2. Create a disaster recovery plan for a cloud-based infrastructure. This should include steps for backing up data, restoring systems, and ensuring data integrity in the event of a disaster.
3. Conduct a security audit of a cloud-based application or service. This should include identifying potential vulnerabilities, testing for weak passwords or other security weaknesses, and making recommendations for improving security.
4. Investigate the use of edge computing in the context of security. Research the benefits and drawbacks of using edge computing for security-sensitive applications, such as industrial control systems or financial systems.
5. Develop a security strategy for a cloud-based infrastructure that includes both network-level and application-level security measures. This should include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and encryption technologies.
6. Research the use of blockchain technology for securing data in the cloud. Investigate the potential benefits and drawbacks of using blockchain for data storage and sharing, and make recommendations for when it would be appropriate to use.
7. Investigate the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in cloud security. Research the benefits and drawbacks of using these technologies for intrusion detection, threat detection, and incident response.
8. Create a security policy for a cloud-based infrastructure. This should include guidelines for user authentication and access control, incident response procedures, and acceptable use policies.
9. Investigate the use of zero-trust architecture in cloud security. Research the benefits and drawbacks of using a zero-trust approach, and make recommendations for when it would be appropriate to use.
10. Research the use of network segmentation in cloud security. Investigate the benefits and drawbacks of using network segmentation, and make recommendations for when it would be appropriate to use in a cloud-based infrastructure. 

### Quiz

**100** __multiple choice__ **questions** (**60% to pass** the exam).
